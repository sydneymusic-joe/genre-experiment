				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p><a href="https://sydneymusic.net">SydneyMusic.net</a> is a not-for-profit, community-centric gig guide.</p>
				<p>Blind Date With A Band is small hack project built by <a href="https://joe.hardy.id.au">Joe Hardy</a> while doing a quick data-gathering experiment with around 100 local Sydney bands on our <a href="https://instagram.com/sydneymusicdotnet">Instagram account</a> last week.</p>
				<p>The data is updated daily and you can use this service as a different kind of gig discovery tool. New recommendations will appear in the mix as they're added to the gig guide.</p>
				<p>Any band featured on this site is playing a show in the next 4 weeks and wrote the genre description themselves.</p>
				<p><strong>If you would like to add your band to the genre tagging experiment</strong>, then please <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Z6nuOgDyI/">add a comment from your official band account on the original post</a> where we gathered the initial data set. We can't guarantee a turnaround time, but we'll do our best.</p>
				<p>We plan to incorporate this data into our gig guide but that will take a little longer and requires resources we don't currently have.</p>
				<p>Speaking of ...</p>
				<h1>SydneyMusic needs funding!</h1>
				<p>SydneyMusic.net has been operating for two years with unpaid contributions from the project's <a href="https://sydneymusic.net/about">co-founders</a> and some additional wonderful volunteers.</p>
				<p>We believe this project is building a highly valuable resource that can greatly benefit Sydney's grassroots music communities, as well as the music industry more broadly. We have a plan to get this project running with operational and financial stability, but it's going to require some investment.</p>

				<p>We hope you enjoy! Catch you at a gig!</p>
